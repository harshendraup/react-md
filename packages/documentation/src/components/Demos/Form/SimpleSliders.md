A `SimpleSlider` is a component that allows the user to select a number value
from a specific range of numbers. This component is fully controlled and
requires the use of the `useSimpleSlider` hook to provide the `value` and
"controls" to updating the `value`. The hook allows for customizing the `min`,
`max`, and `step` options.

The `SimpleSlider` also requires a `baseId` and either an `aria-label` or
`aria-labelledby` for accessibility.

Check out the examples below to see how to use the `useSimpleSlider` hook and a
few of the styling props available for the `SimpleSlider`.
