A `SimpleSlider` is a component that allows the user to select a number value
from a specific range of numbers. This component is fully controlled and
requires the use of the `useSimpleSlider` hook which controls the `value` and
allowing for customizable `min`, `max`, and `step` options. In addition, the
`SimpleSlider` requires a `baseId` and either an `aria-label` or
`aria-labelledby` for accessibility.

Check out the examples below to see how to use the `useSimpleSlider` hook and a
few of the styling props available for the `SimpleSlider`.
